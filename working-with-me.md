# Working with Me

Here's some details and guidelines about working and meeting with me.

## Before you Email <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>  

Professors get copious amounts of email.  To increase your chances of a response:

* Provide context for how I know you. If I don't know you, say how you know me or found my contact information. If you are an NC State student or someone who has been accepted to the Ph.D.  program, please include that information.
* Be clear about the specific thing you are requesting.  If you would like a meeting, specify how much time you need and provide your availability up front. Specify what the goals of such a meeting would be. If you would like feedback on a piece of writing or an idea: sorry, but that service is only available to my research students, established mentees, and close friends.
* To discuss research, good to be brief.  Once your email exceeds 2-3 paragraphs, a short meeting is better (e.g. on Zoom).
* If you are inviting me to join a program committee, please specify an approximatge date range.
* Lastly, it might take a while to respond -- I get copious amounts of email and prefer to give thoughtful responses.

Overall, I welcome email from curious people with similar research interests, especially if you are a member of an under-represented group in computer science. I provide these points of information simply to increase your chances that I will reply in a timely manner.

## Meetings

You'll provide:
- written agenda for every meeting, in advance.
- follow up email to every meeting, summarizing what was decided and what will happen before our next meeting.


## Communication

- I don't answer email on *Saturdays<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>* , so if you send me something late Friday I might not get back to you until Sunday if not later.
